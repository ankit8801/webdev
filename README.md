# Will You Be My Valentine? ðŸ’Œ  
This project is designed to be an interactive webpage to ask someone to be your Valentine.  

## How It Works  
This project consists of a simple webpage with a "Yes" and "No" button. When the user hovers over the "No" button, it moves unpredictably for a few seconds. When clicked, the button cycles through a series of messages, and the "Yes" button gradually grows larger. After a few "No" clicks, the "Yes" button becomes clickable. If the user clicks the "Yes" button, they are redirected to a new page (yes_page.html).  

## Features:  
- **Interactive Buttons**:  
  - The "No" button moves randomly when hovered for 5 seconds.  
  - Clicking "No" cycles through different messages and enlarges the "Yes" button.  
  - After multiple "No" clicks, the "Yes" button becomes clickable.  
- **Responsive Design**: The webpage is designed to work on all screen sizes.  

## How to Use  
### Download the Files:  
Clone this repository or download the `index.html`, `style.css`, `yes_style.css`, `yes_page.html`, and `script.js` files.  

### Open the Project:  
Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.  

## Code Overview  
### Files:  
- `index.html`: The main HTML file that structures the webpage.  
- `style.css`: The CSS file that styles the main webpage.  
- `script.js`: The JavaScript file that handles the button interactions.  
- `yes_page.html`: The "Yes" page that structures the webpage after a successful response.  
- `yes_style.css`: The CSS file that styles the "Yes" webpage.  

### Key Functions:  
- **`handleNoClick()`**: Changes the "No" button text, enlarges the "Yes" button, and enables it after multiple clicks.  
- **`handleYesClick()`**: Redirects the user to `yes_page.html`.  
- **`moveNoButton()`**: Moves the "No" button randomly for the first few seconds when hovered.
